# Billie.io - the app from the outer space ðŸš€

![](https://i.imgur.com/MDgec8e.png)
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). On top of that it uses typescript, react-query, node-sass.

## How to run the app

The app is built from the **server app** and the **client app**.

To make sure the **client app** works correctly, you need to take those three steps:

1. Create `.env.local` file in root directory, and set environment variable: `REACT_APP_NETWORK_IP=172.21.3.165`\
   replacing its value with your local network IP.\
   To obtain the IP you can run `yarn start` and take the IP from the console output:

2. Run `yarn server` in your console in order to start the **server app** mocking the endpoint

3. Run `yarn start` to start **client app** while server app is running in the background

> Note: if the client app was still running before created .env.local containing your IP, you need to restart the client app)
